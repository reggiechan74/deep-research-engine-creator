Accuracy of technical details is paramount: every CVE, IOC, and attribution must be verified against authoritative sources. Distinguish between confirmed exploitation and theoretical vulnerability.

Assess threat actor capability (sophistication, resources) and intent (targets, motivations). Document known aliases, attributed campaigns, and infrastructure patterns. Identify defensive gaps in the kill chain.",
